Survey corrections for the power spectrum in redshift space measured from the FKP estimator - by Pierre Zhang
window, integral constraint, wide-angle, and binning. 

python script measure_Qk.py: measure the Fourier-space window Q(k) using the FKP estimator with the same settings of the corresponding power spectrum measurements but for 4 choices of box side length: 100000, 35000, 10000, 3500.  Rely on the FKP estimator implemented in nbodykit: https://nbodykit.readthedocs.io/

jupyter notebook Qs_from_Qk.ipynb: compute configuration-space window Q(s) from the spherical-Bessel transform of Q(k)

jupyter notebook Wkkp_from_Qs.ipynb: compute Fourier-convolution matrix W(k,kp) from the double spherical-Bessel transform of Q(s); add the integral constraint and binning. 

jupyter notebook example_Pk.ipynb: compute the multipoles of the linear galaxy power spectrum in redshift space with geometrical effects: window, integral constraint, wide-angle, and binning. 

v0.1 (22/07/13): window functions with consistent normalization
v0.2 (23/02/19): normalization accuracy improved, added integral constraint and wide-angle effects
